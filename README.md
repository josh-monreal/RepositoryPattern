# Project Title
This project is a proof-of-concept console application that showcases the repository pattern by using two persistence frameworks - **Entity Framework** and **Stored Procedures**. I have also used dependency injection to decouple the different application layers (i.e. Business and Data layers). The following are the technologies/frameworks that I used for this project.

- .NET Core 2.0 - Console application
- .NET Standard 2.0.3 - Class libraries
- Unity 5.8.6 - Dependency injection
- AutoMapper 7.0.1 - Object-object mapper
- Entity Framework Core 2.0.1 - ORM
